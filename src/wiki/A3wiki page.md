16/9 First meetup through zoom
* Did the group agreement together
* Discussed how we wanted to work on the assignment together.        
* We shared each other’s assignment 2 and had a quick run through to choose a member’s work as a template for the quiz
* Decided to use Trello, an online group task management software, to note down tasks that needed to be done. This software also allowed us to allocate certain tasks to certain members.




17/9 Discord meeting
* We now have a basic template of the quiz implemented.
* We went through the brief and noted down all the necessary features as “to-dos” into Trello. We then further broke down these features into smaller tasks to make the tasks clear for the members who would be in charge of these tasks.
* Ended the meeting after allocating tasks and the order we would do them in.




19/9 started doing fixups 
* All the necessary functions we had originally noted down in Trello have all been done.
* Started to refactor code and look for any bugs.
* Also had a look to see if there were any details we were missing, and if there were, we added them into Trello.
* With a newly updated list of “to-dos” in Trello, we then repeated the same process in completing these tasks.


11/9 Design lecture with clients


22/9 Design meeting 
* After the design lecture, our group had a meeting to discuss the visual designs of the GUI.
* We decided to use Figma, and through a discord meeting at the same time, we discussed ideas and played around with different design ideas. 
* After we came up with a design everyone was happy with, we split the tasks up and individually did our own parts.


23/9
* Code is refactored and comments added




24/9 
* All our design elements had been added to the GUI
* We all then had a look a made further edits if we felt they were necessary
* We also had a look through the entire application to see if we were missing anything. Through this, we realised we had to think of another way to allow users to use macrons in the application as we weren’t able to directly type macrons into the textfield. In the end, we decided to add another button to solve this.
